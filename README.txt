Introduction
============

Quintagroup Captcha Core (quintagroup.captcha.core) allows to configure captchas
on your Plone site. 

This product does not add captcha to your Plone forms, it only allows its configuring. 
To protect Plone forms with captcha - use quintagroup.plonecaptchas package.  

After product installation you'll see 'Plone captchas setup' option under 
'Add-on Product Configuration' in Site Setup. There you can select what kind 
of captchas you want to appear: either static or dynamic. In case you select 
dynamic - captcha images will be generated on the fly and you will be able to
